Finally an Extendable Responsive and Generally Useful System

This project is designed to be cross platform, although will be developed with the intention of using a [Raspberry PI] - or similar Linux capable board (BeagleBone, Parallela, Galileo, etc) - to create a simple interactive butler (J.A.R.V.I.S. inspired, of course).  Developing on such platforms has the benefit of [GPIO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) pins, unique modules, and of course affordability.  Ok, so the term butler loosly describes taking requests from the user, processing/handling them, and responding in an interactive & effective manner.  You can think of this as an audio-responsive aid/helper for your, applications, hardware, and/or everyday repetative tasks.

FERGUS is designed with the intention of being a stable project that others can extend to use for any application or hardware they choose. The overall ability of FERGUS is highly dependent on the core system and inevitably to some degree the library of applications that have been added to it.

The intent is to create a packaged project that can be grabbed and easily extended.
