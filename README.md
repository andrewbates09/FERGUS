Finally an Effective Responsive and Generally Useful System

This project is designed to use a [Raspberry PI] - or similar Linux capable board (BeagleBone, Parallela, Galileo, etc) - to create a simple interactive butler (J.A.R.V.I.S. inspired, of course).  The ability of FERGUS is dependent on the number of applications that have been added to it.

The intent is to create a packaged project that can be grabbed and easily extended.
